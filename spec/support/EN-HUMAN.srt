00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,740
Hi! welcome back.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,680
I hope the first quiz

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,900
wasn't too easy

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,860
and wasn't too difficult.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Let's look at the quiz.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,920
______ name is Lili.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Lili

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,760
My name is Lili.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,860
or

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,420
I'm name is Lili.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,540
which one?

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,980
Let's look.

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,100
My name is Lili.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,940
Yeah.

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,320
So, we say "My name is (name)."

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,980
If we want to say "I'm",

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,380
we can say "I'm Lili."

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,740
But we can not say

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm name.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,800
It's not right.

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,420
I'm Lili.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,160
or

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,520
My name is Lili.

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,860
_______ we can call this "blank."

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,020
So,
